      <h2>Install</h2>
      <p>
        To use this tool just click and drag the link below to your bookmarks bar:
      </p>
      <a id="bookmarkletLink" class="bookmarkletLink" href="#">ABBA Editor Bookmarklet</a>
      <p>
        For some browsers and devices you may need to:
        <ul>

          <li>Bookmark this page</li>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Just click the bookmarked link and it will start up on your currently open page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool opens a popup listing all currently active ABBA split-tests. For each test there will be a list of possible variants, their names and weights. Clicking each variant will switch you over to that version - just refresh the page for the changes to take effect ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        The bookmarklet reads split-test data out of the <i>hx.abba._tests</i> object which is exposed on the <i>tripapp</i> platform of <i>holidayextras.co.uk</i> (i.e. it'll only work there).
